# EdocReadme
Hello, our team’s name is Edoc and i will further present the app entitled E-dochub 
and the role it fulfills in the life of a student. Our app adresses to a large mass of students 
that are looking forward to applying to their university of choice by creating their own 
portofolios containing their achievemnts and the activities they attend to, along with finding 
all the information for what they are particulalry searching for. 
Here you log in the app, you add your personal data and click submit to create the 
account. 
This is the startpage where you can find every section in the app ( this comes very 
easy if you would like to access it from your mobile phone) and you simply click to view the 
page of your account/ events/ admission/(feed)/contact. 
On the feed you are able to view latest reccomandations and also templates and 
types of activities, competitions of other users for inspiration. 
Then there is “My account” and if you click on it, you see everything about you: your 
own portofolio where you can add diplomas, results, competitions, prizes you have won and 
which you are able to share via email (if you want to send it directly to the university you can 
do that) and download it as a PDF. 
“My profile” is your confidential information in which you can edit as well and of 
course “My faculties” is where you save your university options and you also have the 
possibility of writing and checking the required results, experience, courses and activity for 
getting into each university. 
What does “Events” stand for? Well, This is where the students can have access to 
volunteering events, educational activities and courses they need for their portofolios and 
where we promote companies hosting these educational events by displaying the links of the 
google forms for the registration to the related activities/courses. These companies pay us 
for recomanding them on the first page from the events feed on an app accessed by all the 
students that want to create an organized portofolio for their future. As an example: 
Volunteering events, cultural etc. 
In “Admission” you view the links that lead to the university you add, you also have a 
short description about the university and its admission requiremens (this is really helpful for 
any student to compare this List to the one they have created in “My faculties” . 
In “Contact” you will be able to contact us and find out more about us, here is 
displayed a description. If you click the search bar and type anything related to the 
information you have added you will imediatelly find it without any problem. 
Thank you for your attention and i would like to add that our goal regarding this app 
is to encourage all students to not only be organized with their valuable documents and 
information but also support their dream of being admitted to the university of their dreams 
and following their maximum capacities along with gaining as much substantial experience as 
possible because knowledge is important, but added to experience and passion represents 
far more, and without a clear and organized structure, it is very hard to achieve it.
To create the code, we used the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages and used both 
components created by us and example components from bootstrap.
